# Java Studies
This is my repository dedicated to my studies and notes about the Java language. My studies were based on the Capgemini Course "Start by Capgemini",founded on: capgeminischool.brazilsouth.cloudapp.azure.com
Here I take my notes about all the theoretical content of each topic of the course, and in my other repository (JavaExercises) I do all the practical study with the exercises they give in their platform.

* The comments and notes made in all files were written in Brazilian Portuguese, but I'm planning to translate everything into English, first to universalize my code and also to improve my level of English. Please, if you, watcher, see any mistake about the sintaxe or sense of written, alert me.
